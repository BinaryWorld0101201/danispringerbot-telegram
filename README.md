# How can I use this code?
- I'm soon overhauling this README to (hopefully) be much easier to understand and use. First, I'm overhauling the bot itself! :D
- For now, please see this great article (written in Italian): [https://www.salvatorecordiano.it/creare-un-bot-telegram-guida-passo-passo/](https://www.salvatorecordiano.it/creare-un-bot-telegram-guida-passo-passo/)
- Note: rename "register.template.php" to register.php
